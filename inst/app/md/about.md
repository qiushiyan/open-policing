The application uses data comes from the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/), which counts traffic records from millions of traffic stops by law enforcement agencies across the country, with a goal to help researchers, journalists, and policymakers investigate and improve interactions between police and the public.

We have truncated the data down to only records in the state of Tennessee and provided both transactional and analytical capabilities. Users can insert and edit records of persons and traffic stop locations. In regards to analysis, the focus is to investigate race, sex and arrest related statistics for possible discrimination issues.
